# SCANOSS VSCode Plugin

The SCANOSS plugin for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is an indispensable tool designed to enhance open source management within the widely-used code editor. By leveraging the OSSKB.org API endpoint provided by the Software Transparency Foundation, this plugin offers developers real-time visibility into software's composition, accurately identifying both declared and undeclared dependencies, components, files, and even code snippets.

With the increasing adoption of AI-generated code and the risk of plagiarism, it is crucial to validate the origin and compliance of such code. The SCANOSS plugin utilizes the extensive SCANOSS knowledgebase to assess potential security vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and compliance risks directly within the VSCode environment. This empowers developers to effectively manage open source components, ensuring the security, reliability, and compliance of their software throughout the development process.
